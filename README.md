# Calculator

I've tried creating a Calculator using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

ðŸ”— **Live preview:** [here](https://shinratensei02.github.io/Light_Calculator/)

## Built with

### Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JS

### Tools

* Visual Studio Code
* MacOS terminal
* Git and GitHub
* Affinity Designer

### Third party code

* None

## Outcome

* Used HTML5 **semantic elements** for better readability and structure.
* Used CSS3 **grid** and **flex** to create layout.
* Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management.

* The calculator is able to perfom the 5 basic operations
* The calculator can handle decimal values
* Multiple presses of the operator buttons or the equal sign do not cause the application to crash and it keeps it's original values


## Update!

I felt unsatisfied with some parts of my project, so I've created an improved second version of my calculator!
